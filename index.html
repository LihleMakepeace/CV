          <p>I am a well round, determined individual who is always looking to better himself and eager to learn. I work well under pressure as I can easily adapt to a new situation and able to work with a team. My interests include traveling, hiking, nature watching and sports. In the future I would like to get into Software Development, Cyber security, Embedded systems, Robotics and AI to expand my knowledge of the ever changing technological world. I have acquired the knowledge and skills of using most Electrical Engineering software that a technician should know. I am in the process of acquiring the knowledge and skills of a Computer Engineering technologist should have through the completion of my Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree in Computer Engineering.</p>
